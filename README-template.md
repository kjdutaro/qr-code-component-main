## Overview

This is a quick project of a QR code component that I wrote from the design that was provided from the site.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I know that this is just going back to basics. I played with the custom layout a bit and tried to at least copy the design provided as close as possible. I did struggle a bit on how to center the component vertically with flex but instead opted to use transform instead.

### Continued development

I will be trying to maybe replicate this with tailwindcss soon.
